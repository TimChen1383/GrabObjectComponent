# GrabObjectComponent_UE

 The Grabber component let you grab and highlight an object in Unreal Engine level in runtime by using physics handle. 
 
/n To make the Grabber component work, you need to do follow :
- Add Grabber component to default pawn (if we play the game with default pawn)
- Set Grabber component’s “SearchScale” to the value we want as it will be the length of physics handle
- Set Grabber component’s “HighlighValue” to the value we want as it will control the highlight value when we pick an object up
- Make sure the objects we want to grab has enable “simulate physics” and set the collision preset to “PhysicsActor”
- Add a scalar parameter called “Highlight” in the pick-up object’s material and connect to emissive. We can control the highlight value in runtime if we have the object been picked up
